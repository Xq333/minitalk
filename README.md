# minitalk Project README

## Overview

The **minitalk** project is an intriguing journey in my 42 school curriculum. This project challenged me to create a simple client-server application for sending and receiving short messages using Unix signals in a real-time environment.

## What I Learned

Through the **minitalk** project, I gained valuable knowledge and skills, including:

1. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: I learned how to facilitate communication between different processes in a Unix environment, using signals as a means of data transmission.

2. **Signal Handling**: This project honed my signal handling skills, allowing me to send and receive signals, interpret their meaning, and respond accordingly.

3. **Message Encoding and Decoding**: I gained expertise in encoding and decoding messages for signal transmission, enabling the exchange of text-based information.

4. **Real-Time Messaging**: The project emphasized real-time communication, as messages are transmitted and received immediately upon sending.

## Project Structure

The **minitalk** project typically includes the creation of both client and server programs, signal-based communication, message encoding and decoding, and real-time messaging. It's a practical exercise in inter-process communication and networking concepts.

## Usage

The skills I acquired through the **minitalk** project are applicable to various real-time messaging and communication scenarios. This project equips me with the ability to create lightweight, signal-based communication systems.

## Credits

This project was completed as part of my 42 school curriculum.
